# Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ––

Projects here are mostly experimental and/or for fun, so donâ€™t hesitate looking
around â€“ I recommend checking out my pinned repositories first.

Iâ€™m currently working at [Talenthouse](https://talenthouse.com) as a Lead
Front-End Engineer. You can hit me up on hello [at] michelegera [dot] dev or
find out more about me on [my website](https://michelegera.dev).
